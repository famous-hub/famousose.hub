 <p>
    Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said star forward 
    Vinicius Junior will be back from injury quicker than expected
     to face Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday.

    The Brazilian winger suffered a hamstring injury in
     November which was expected to keep him out until the
      Intercontinental Cup final on December 18.
    
    However Vinicius was able to train on Friday and
     Ancelotti said he would return next week, missing 
     Saturday’s La Liga visit to face Girona.
    
    “Vini has recovered from his injury very well, he will
     not be ready for tomorrow but he will be for the next 
     Champions League game,” Ancelotti told a news conference Friday.
    
    Vinicius’ return bolsters a Madrid side which has suffered
     three defeats in their opening five European matches,
